only teams from same event can be scheduled together.

during coed game only coed game can be played


-There are situations with odd number of teams that one team needs to play an extra game in
 order for all teams to get the desired number of games (e.g.
 there’s no way 3 teams can play one game each, one of the teams needs to play 2). This is acceptable.
